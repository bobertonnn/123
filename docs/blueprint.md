## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#70A1FF) to evoke trust and reliability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4FF).
- Accent color: Muted purple (#A685E2) for a touch of creativity and differentiation.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font providing a clean, objective and neutral look. It is perfect for a single-font design as it suits equally well to body and headline.

- Subtle animations for status feedback (e.g., a loading spinner during validation) to improve user experience.
